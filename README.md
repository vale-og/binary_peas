# Are there peas in binary pods?
## Comparing the peas-in-a-pod architecture in single and binary star systems
Exoplanet surveys have established that planet formation is a common outcome of star formation, producing a diverse population of planetary systems that extends well beyond the architecture of the Solar System. Statistical studies show that small planets, like super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, dominate the exoplanet population, particularly at short orbital periods, while gas giants are comparatively rare and strongly correlated with host-star metallicity (Howard et al. 2012; Petigura et al. 2013; Fulton et al. 2017). The difference in these populations hint at the fact that planet formation is linked to stellar properties like mass and metallicity.

Results from Kepler show that planets do not form in isolation. Multiplanet systems are common and often dynamically stable, with low mutual inclinations and nearly circular orbits (Lissauer et al. 2011; Fabrycky et al. 2014), in compact configurations with regular orbital spacing.

Moreso, planets frequently exhibit correlated properties, including similar radii, masses, and orbital spacings—an effect known as the **peas-in-a-pod** phenomenon (Weiss et al. 2018; Millholland et al. 2017). Multiplanet systems therefore provide a powerful framework for probing planet formation and evolution. 

Nonetheless, even though surveys tend to control for stellar properties (meaning, there is an underlying selection for stars with specific masses or metallicities), binarity is sometimes ignored, both for how difficult it is to find binary companions, and because the effects of a secondary star are not well constrained yet (Kraus et al. 2016, Ziegler et al. 2018). With the arrival of Gaia we have been able to find and confirm more binary stars than ever (El-Badry et al. 2021), and it has been shown that multiplicity is a very important factor in star formation.

Because of this, in this project I attempt to compare the population of known peas-in-a-pod (PIAP) systems to those that host a second star, to see how well the populations match eachother, or in the contrary, how much they differ.
